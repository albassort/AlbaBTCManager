  I had previously set this to finished when, I wasn't thinking about it properly.I finished it in the commit this string appears
* DONE Implement transaction tracking and notifications 
  SCHEDULED: <2025-09-07 Sun> DEADLINE: <2025-09-08 Mon> CLOSED: <2025-09-09 04:30>
  AlbaBTCPay should be able to track transactions and notify you when some of them get through. 

* DONE Implement API
  SCHEDULED: <2025-09-08 Mon> DEADLINE: <2025-09-11 Thu> CLOSED: <2025-09-11 Thu>
  AlbaBTCPay needs a fully functioning API. A high level API to abstract away the interactions between Lightning 

** DONE Bind Lightning
   SCHEDULED: <2025-09-08 Mon> DEADLINE: <2025-09-15 Mon>
  Lightning should work smoothly and properly, in a centralized way, that makes all applications reliant upon it responsive.

   As of this commit, its mostly implemented. There's more parts of the API of the API to expose. Currently we have: creating invoices, opening channels, closing channels, paying invoices. 

   I want to add peers, and a few more endpoint scenarios like hold channels before startinb to build high level structures

*** DONE Implement peer connect notifications
*** DONE Implement channel opening notifications
*** DONE  Implement invoice generation 
  CLOSED: <2025-09-10 04:55>
*** TODO Implement notifications for when a given invoice was paid across a channel
    Kinda done. I mean, it came with getting the listeners working but specific invoices, no.
*** TODO TXID Channel monitoring

    I'm not sure if this is required because, in abstract, channels you don't create have no meaning. Anyone can open them to you. If they don't pay your invoices, you have no part in that. However, it might be uesful to monitor if a channel you made is closed. It might also be useful if you 
    1. Make an invoice
    2. This invoice has a callback identifier 
    3. The person who paid this's IP and Pubkey becomes associated with the callback
    4. When something happens to this chanenl, the piece of data associated with them will be used a shorthand for it
    5. It also means you build data on clients, could be useful.

    Previous entry was: "When a channel is opened, it gives you a "pending_channel", however, the TXID associated with this needs to be tracked. In addition, channels needs to be check periodically"


** DONE Connect BTC to the API
   SCHEDULED: <2025-09-10 Wed> DEADLINE: <2025-09-11 Thu>
   Although most of the BTC implements have been fully programmed, they still need to be connected to the API. This includes.

   The BTC implementation is far more minimal compared to the LND implementation

*** DONE Generating payment request
*** TODO Transferring payments

* TODO implement extensive testing on ALL api calls.
  SCHEDULED: <2025-09-08 Mon> DEADLINE: <2025-09-16 Tue>
  To do this, I should be making tests as I implement each API endpoint, separately;y

* TODO Make build pipeline in docker
  SCHEDULED: <2025-09-14 Sun> DEADLINE: <2025-09-16 Tue>
  In order to sufficiently test in docker, we must build in docker, and we should be implementing this via a github pipline for anightly build release, which can be installed via docker

* TODO fully implement distribution in docker.
  SCHEDULED: <2025-09-14 Sun> DEADLINE: <2025-09-19 Fri>
  I don't know much about docker. I've implemented testing in podman, this will be quick or slow, who can say?

* TODO Release
  DEADLINE: <2025-09-20 Sat>
